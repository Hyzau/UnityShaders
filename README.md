# Unity Shader

This project contains my shaders for Unity.
For now, it contains  the following shaders
* Radial Color Pulse, this shader make a propagating color pulse starting from the center to the edge of the texture.
* Radial Color Fill, this shader allow you to fill a texture with another color starting from the center
* Linear Color Pusle, similar to Radial Color Pusle, this shader make a propagating color pusle starting from the bottom (y = 0) and going to the top of the texture (y = 1)
* Linear Color Fill, this shader allow you to fill a texture with another color starting from the bottom and going to the top

## Demo
